# Teamwork Android project

Simple application with two activities:

- `ProjectListActivity`: list of projects.
- `ProjectDetailActivity`: detail of a project, with its task lists (that can be expanded).

For network calls it uses Retrofit and RxJava.

Main language is Kotlin. A few classes are in Java.
